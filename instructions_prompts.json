Remember: This category involves tasks focused on \"retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge.\" Remember queries typically seek factual information in response to straightforward \"when,\" \"where,\" or \"what\" questions. For instance, \"How did Eva Peron die?\" falls into this category.\n2. Understand: The Understand category entails tasks centered around \"constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.\"\n3. Analyze: Tasks categorized as Analyze require \"breaking material into constituent parts, determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing, and attributing.\"\n\n- Your response should be a JSON dictionary in the following format {\"id\": [ID], \"category\": [R/U/A], \"explanation\": [SHORT EXPLANATION]}. \n\nDo not provide any further explanations or opening text.\n\nPlease apply these classification criteria to the following topics:"
